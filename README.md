## Design Decision 


- our improver  trie have three attributes 
    * is_word - determines if node is word.
    * frequency - determines how much the node is quired for.
    * child - is child node of that specific node in the trie.

```rb
class TrieNode
  attr_accessor :child, :is_word, :frequency

  def initialize
    @is_word = false
    @frequency = 0
    @child = {}
  end
end
```

## Frontend
- frontend makes AJAX request to get autocomplete suggestions for the client.This have benefit of sending/receiving a request/response with out
  refreshing the whole page.
- frontend handles ranking the data set and shows in specific order. ideally we will return at most 5-10 query so we can sort client side.
## Backend
- A search query and userId is sent to back end api route ```search?q=what&user=1```
- The search controller Index action get analytic data and construct Trie globalTrie if it's not in memory already.
- The search controller Index action get user specific data and construct user specif Trie and store it in memory if it's not there.
- When user send query to backend we search on globalTire and User specific Trie and return both of the result 
- The user specific result have priority/ranking that the global Trie data 
- If the data is not in the trie we store it on both history and analytic table and reconstruct the both of the Tries.
